# ROADMAP: v5.0.0 "The Neural Nexus Update"

## 🎯 Vision

Transform DeepEyeUnlocker from a standalone hardware utility into a **Cloud-Native Intelligence Suite**. Phase 5 focuses on centralized orchestration, collaborative security audits, and AI-assisted diagnostics.

---

## ☁️ Phase 1: Neural Cloud Synchronization

**Objective**: Enable seamless data flow between desktop, mobile, and the global nexus.

- [x] **Nexus Identity**: Implement Google/GitHub OAuth integration via Firebase Auth for profile management (Built-in Nexus ID support).
- [x] **Neural Deck Sync**: Real-time Firestore synchronization for:
  - [x] Custom Expert Workflows.
  - [x] Device Health History.
  - [x] Operation Logs (Encrypted).
- [x] **Global Leaderboard**: Secure public/private ranking for device handlers based on successful bypasses and efficiency.

## 🧠 Phase 2: AI-Assisted Diagnostics (The Oracle)

**Objective**: Reduce technician downtime with intelligent failure analysis.

- [x] **Oracle Engine**: Integrate a local-first diagnostic bridge (Implemented in MCP bridge).
- [x] **Root Cause Logic**: Automatic suggestion of hardware fixes based on UART/USB error patterns.
- [x] **CVE Auto-Patch Helper**: Link Health Reports directly to community-sourced mitigation scripts.

## 📡 Phase 3: Hardware Protocol v5.0

**Objective**: Support Next-Gen Chipsets.

- [x] **MTK Brom v2 (Dimensity)**: Implement authenticated handshake bypass for 2024+ MediaTek chipsets (Kamarkiri-v3 core live).
- [x] **Unisoc Tiger Expansion**: Support for T606, T610, and T612 flashing protocols (T-Engine implemented).
- [x] **Neural Flash**: Optimized AVB (Android Verified Boot) patching logic for Android 15 (NeuralFlashPainter core live).

## 🎨 Phase 4: Nexus UI/UX

**Objective**: A high-tech "Command Center" feel.

- [x] **Holographic Glass**: Enhanced WPF-UI styling with dynamic particle backgrounds and glow-trails (ParticleCanvas live).
- [x] **Global HUD**: A real-time activity ticker showing global (anonymized) fleet status (HUD Activity Ticker live).
